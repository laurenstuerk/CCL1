# Diary Entry No. 1

Today marks the first day of my journey in creating a video game for the Creative Code Lab. Here’s what I accomplished:

1. **Started with a 2D Game Template**  
   I used the 2D game templat.

2. **Implemented a Character**  
   - Set up basic player movement using keyboard input.  
   - Added a jump mechanic, which felt like a big milestone.
  
3. **Optimized Jump Physics and Added Double Jump**  
   - Adjusted the jump mechanics to feel more responsive.  
   - Added a double-jump feature, which already makes the gameplay more dynamic and fun.

4. **Created a Block Class**  
   - Designed it to handle obstacles and platforms.  
   - It’s still basic, but it works for now.  

5. **Added Placeholder Images**  
   - Added a placeholder background image and a character sprite.  
   - Even these simple visuals made the game feel more alive.  

6. **Set Up the Floor and Side-Scrolling Elements**  
   - Implemented a floor for the character to stand on.  
   - Made the camera follow the character while the world scrolles.
